# formality-mining
Data mining project for automatic classification of text comments into five formality levels.

## Project Overview
This project is part of the **Data Mining course** and aims to develop an **automatic text classifier** capable of determining the formality level of comments written in Spanish, with special emphasis on linguistic variations from Peru.  

The classification is based on five levels of formality:  
- 4 → Very Formal  
- 3 → Formal  
- 2 → Neutral  
- 1 → Informal  
- 0 → Very Informal / Vulgar

The analysis explores linguistic, stylistic, and contextual patterns to identify the degree of formality in text, applying data mining techniques and machine learning models.
